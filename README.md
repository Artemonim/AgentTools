## 🚀 Overview

Welcome to **Artemonim's Agent Tools** - a growing ecosystem of specialized tools designed to enhance AI-assisted development workflows. Each tool in this collection addresses specific challenges developers face when working with AI coding assistants, from code comprehension to quality assurance.

## 🛠️ Tools in the Ecosystem

### 📋 [Agent Compass](https://github.com/Artemonim/AgentCompass)

## 🎯 Why This Ecosystem?

### The Problem

AI coding assistants are powerful but often lack context about:

-   Your project's coding standards and architecture
-   The structure and relationships in your codebase
-   Quality requirements and best practices
-   Their GUI work leaves much to be desired.

### The Solution

Each tool in the Artemonim's Agent Tools ecosystem addresses a specific aspect of this challenge:

1. **Agent Compass** → Establishes consistent behavior and standards
2. **Agent Docstrings** → Provides instant code structure understanding
3. **Agent Enforcer** → Ensures quality and compliance
4. **Agent Viewport** → Enables UI-aware development

Together, they create a comprehensive framework for professional AI-assisted development.

## 🚀 Getting Started

### Quick Start Guide

1. **Start with Agent Compass** - Set up your AI assistant's behavior patterns
2. **Add Agent Docstrings** - Generate code structure documentation
3. **Monitor with Agent Enforcer** - Ensure code quality (when available)
4. **Enhance with Agent Viewport** - Add UI awareness (when available)

### Integration Examples

```bash
# Install available tools
pip install agent-docstrings

# Add Agent Compass rules to your IDE
# Configure Agent Enforcer (Coming July 2025)
```
