## 🎯 Why This Ecosystem?

### The Problem

AI coding assistants are powerful but often lack context about:

-   Your project's coding standards and architecture
-   The structure and relationships in your codebase
-   Quality requirements and best practices
-   UI/UX patterns and component hierarchies

### The Solution

Each tool in the Artemonim's Agent Tools ecosystem addresses a specific aspect of this challenge:

1. **Agent Compass** → Establishes consistent behavior and standards
2. **Agent Docstrings** → Provides instant code structure understanding
3. **Agent Enforcer** → Ensures quality and compliance
4. **Agent Viewport** → Enables UI-aware development

Together, they create a comprehensive framework for professional AI-assisted development.

## 🚀 Getting Started

### Quick Start Guide

1. **Start with Agent Compass** - Set up your AI assistant's behavior patterns
2. **Add Agent Docstrings** - Generate code structure documentation
3. **Monitor with Agent Enforcer** - Ensure code quality (when available)
4. **Enhance with Agent Viewport** - Add UI awareness (when available)

### Integration Examples
